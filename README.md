Learners of the Gaussian Mixture Model

# Objective
This is a long term project. 

I encounter Gaussian Mixture Model during my PhD study. 

I have also written several papers on this topic. 

Now I want to group all the popular algorithms and methods (including mine) in one place.

I will upload the code and related materials here.
